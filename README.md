Smaller subprojects or random output that was generated along the way  

rave.tap - tape conversion of https://zxaaa.net/view_demo.php?id=11931 for Covox testing purposes - takes roughly 9 minutes to load.  

p128_conversion.png - shifts paper 8px to the right to align it with the border (i.e. required for the final part of RAGE) and generates a proper sync signal.  

lpt_pinout.png - unintuitive pinout of the LPT port.  

testfe_compiled.tap - small testprogram for showing the active address/data lines for keyboard inputs. Originally written in BASIC, now compiled (can be OTLA'd). Was used for debugging the programmable joystick interface which emulates keyboard presses.
