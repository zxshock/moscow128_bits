Smaller subprojects or random output that was generated along the way  

rave.tap - tape conversion of https://zxaaa.net/view_demo.php?id=11931 for Covox testing purposes - takes roughly 9 minutes to load.  
rave.tzx - same as above, but taking somewhere around 1/2 to 1/3 of the time.

lpt_pinout.png - unintuitive pinout of the LPT port.
